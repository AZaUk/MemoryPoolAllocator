# MemoryPoolAllocator

A high-performance memory pool allocator designed for efficient memory management in C++ projects.

## Features

- **Fast Allocation/Deallocation**: Reduces memory fragmentation and improves performance by reusing memory blocks.
- **Custom Pool Sizes**: Supports pools tailored to specific object sizes.
- **Thread-Safe**: Offers thread-safe allocation for concurrent applications (if applicable).
- **Lightweight**: Minimal overhead and highly configurable.

## Installation

Clone the repository and include the allocator in your project:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AZaUk/MemoryPoolAllocator.git
```

Then include the necessary header files in your project:

```cpp
#include "MemoryPoolAllocator.h"
```

Alternatively, copy the relevant files into your project directory.

---

## Usage

Hereâ€™s a quick example of how to use the MemoryPoolAllocator:

```cpp
#include "MemoryPoolAllocator.h"

struct MyStruct {
    int id;
    char name[50];
};

int main() {
    // Create a memory pool for MyStruct objects
    MemoryPoolAllocator<MyStruct> pool(100); // Preallocate space for 100 objects

    // Allocate an object from the pool
    MyStruct* obj = pool.allocate();
    obj->id = 1;
    strcpy(obj->name, "Example");

    // Deallocate the object
    pool.deallocate(obj);

    return 0;
}
```

## API Documentation

### `MemoryPoolAllocator`

#### Constructor

```cpp
MemoryPoolAllocator(size_t blockSize, size_t numBlocks);
```

- **blockSize**: The size of a block the pool can preallocate.
- **numBlocks**: The number of blocks the pool can preallocate.

#### Methods

- **`T* allocate()`**  
  Allocates memory for a single object of type `T`.

- **`void deallocate(T* ptr)`**  
  Releases the memory back to the pool.
